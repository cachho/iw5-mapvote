# iw5-mapvote
IW5 mapvote for dedicated servers.

Installation:
* Download the .gsc file from the main repository.
* Place the .gsc file at %localappdata%/plutonium/storage/iw5/scripts.
* Note: Create folders if they do not exist.

Additional features of the 2 Map version:
* Count cast votes/total players instead of selection index in top right corner
* switch between A and B, no matter what key you press. UI only shows fire-key, because everyone will have that bound.
* Random selection if votes for both maps is equal.
* UI adjusted to two maps.
* 20 seconds timer because less time should be needed to decide between two maps.
