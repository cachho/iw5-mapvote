# iw5-mapvote
IW5 mapvote for dedicated servers.

## Installation:
* Download the .gsc file from the main repository.
* Place the .gsc file at %localappdata%/plutonium/storage/iw5/scripts.
* Note: Create folders if they do not exist.

## 2-Map Version
Limits the selection to two maps to mimic the original feeling of MW3 lobbies.
Additionally, six maps showed to have a high chance to give the same selection of maps, which resulted in the most popular maps always being picked with no chance for variety. While picking the map you want to play is the whole point, there should be some variety and differnt maps should get thrown in the mix. 

### Additional features of the 2-Map version:
* switch between A and B, no matter what key you press. UI only shows fire-key, because everyone will have that bound.
* Count cast votes/total players instead of selection index in top right corner
* Random selection if votes for both maps are equal.
* UI adjusted to two maps.
* 20 seconds timer because less time should be needed to decide between two maps.
